Dear Israel,

There has been many times where I’ve asked why you were in my life, why you’ve stayed despite my insanity, why we still ended up speaking after “the incident”, how most of our lives have nearly led the exact same paths with the exact same detours despite being so different. And I think the thing that has brought us together is … fate. Or destiny as you said last night. I look at what I was looking for this summer, or even winter break. I've been looking for someone exactly like you my whole life. I've spent so much of my life begging nearly every force in the universe for someone that would be kind & patient with me despite my closed off & self destructive tendencies, someone that would take care of me the way I take care of other people around me, someone that would see the darkest and worst parts of myself and not run away, but instead pull me closer. And I’ve found that in you. I think when I'm with you I can't help but face what I try to run away from, because I’ve never been this vulnerable with anyone before, I still think of that conversation we had in the library, when you asked if you were someone I could fall in love with. I remember I got so scared that I felt like my heart was bursting out my chest. I was feeling something I had never felt before, I was imagining a future of us being intertwined forever. I can't think of someone better than you to fall in love with. You're patient, kind, intelligent, caring and maybe the most responsible and put together person I know. You are exceptional, an anomaly from anyone else I’ve ever met. I miss you already and I hope you write back soon.

Love,
Vanessa
