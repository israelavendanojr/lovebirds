Hi Israel

I think you may have fibbled when you said you couldn’t write. Your letter was poetry, and it proved you really aren’t a robot. You might actually like me? Maybe even something more? I keep bringing up how you weren’t immediately interested in me. It’s different from everyone else that has liked me, but I think it means you started liking me for who I am, not how I look. I always assumed that looks were the best I had to offer, that nobody who really knew me could ever love me, but apparently who I am is what made you stay. 

I see how carefully edited your writing was, with perfect syntax and impeccable grammar, not a word wasted. It’s such a stark contrast to my letters, where you can see my lack of structure, unfinished or over-explained thoughts and scribbled out spelling mistakes. We are so very opposite, but I think in the most important way we are in each other's life to learn from each other.

I still wonder how you can be so sure about me, so often I feel I don't deserve someone as exceptional as you. I don’t understand how you can’t see how amazing you really are, but I’ll tell you as long as you need to hear it. And even when you don’t NEED it, I’ll still tell you, don’t worry.

You’re in nearly every dream I have now, usually the center of every one, never a side character, you are the most integral part of my stories. My freudian dream analysis says that you are taking up the biggest section of my brain.

We’re going to see eachother so soon (just two week and 16 hours), I keep imagining what our reuniting moment will look like, will I get shy and afraid? Will my heart feel like its going to beat out of my chest? Will I sneak up behind you unannounced? Or will I tackle you into the ground? I guess we’ll see.

Ps: I feel alot better now, I think it will make this (us) all the better
